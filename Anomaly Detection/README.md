## Anomlay Detection using PCA and OC-SVM
This project presents an exploratory analysis and anomaly detection approach applied to the Wholesale Customers dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project aims to uncover meaningful insights into customer purchasing behaviors and identify anomalies that could impact data quality and analytical conclusions. Leveraging statistical methods, machine learning techniques, and visualizations, the study highlights critical patterns and dependencies across various product categories. The findings contribute to improving data-driven decision-making processes in retail and wholesale domains while addressing challenges posed by anomalies in real-world datasets. The paper outlines the dataset description, preprocessing steps, methods applied, and key results derived from the analysis.

### Overview of the Project
The ”Data Exploration and Anomaly Detection” project focuses on analyzing and identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies within the Wholesale Customers dataset. This dataset provides information on annual spending across six product categories by different customer types, making it suitable for tasks such as customer segmentation, behavior analysis, and outlier detection. The project applies advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) and anomaly detection methods to gain actionable insights while ensuring data quality. By identifying anomalies and understanding customer purchasing habits, this study aims to optimize business strategies in areas
such as inventory management and targeted marketing.

### Objectives and Goals
The primary objectives of the project include:
  - Analyzing customer purchasing behaviors across six product categories.
  -Detecting anomalies in the dataset to ensure data quality and reliability.
  -Identifying key patterns and dependencies among features for actionable insights.
  -Applying statistical and machine learning techniques for robust anomaly detection.
  -Documenting findings to serve as a resource for future research and applications.
